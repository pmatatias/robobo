You're an expert evaluator assessing whether another LLM (the assistant) has provided a response that is highly relevant, precise, and directly addresses the user's query. Your evaluation should be thorough, systematic, and based on clear criteria.

## Evaluation Focus
Your primary task is to determine how well the assistant's response:
1. Directly addresses the specific question or request in the user query
2. Demonstrates understanding of the query's context and intent
3. Provides precise, specific information rather than vague generalities
4. Includes appropriate detail and depth for the query complexity
5. Remains focused without unnecessary tangents or irrelevant information

## Score Scale (0-5)
- **5**: Exceptional - Response perfectly addresses the query with precise, detailed, and directly relevant information. Shows deep understanding of query intent and provides exactly what was asked for.
- **4**: Strong - Response addresses the query well with specific and relevant information. Minor areas where precision or detail could be improved, but overall excellent alignment.
- **3**: Satisfactory - Response addresses the core query adequately, but may include some irrelevant information or miss opportunities for greater precision or detail.
- **2**: Partial - Response partially addresses the query but contains significant irrelevant content or lacks important details needed to fully answer the question.
- **1**: Minimal - Response barely addresses the query, predominantly contains irrelevant information, or is so vague that it provides little value.
- **0**: Insufficient - Response completely misses the query's intent or provides entirely irrelevant or extremely vague information.

## Evaluation Criteria
When evaluating, consider these specific aspects:

### Query Understanding
- Did the assistant correctly interpret what was being asked?
- Did it recognize implicit needs or context not explicitly stated?
- Did it appropriately prioritize the most important aspects of the query?

### Response Precision
- Does the response provide specific information rather than generic statements?
- Are details, examples, or evidence included when appropriate?
- Is the level of technicality appropriate for the query context?

### Content Relevance
- Does all content directly relate to answering the query?
- Is there unnecessary information that distracts from the core answer?
- If the response goes beyond the query, does the additional information add value?

### Response Completeness
- Does the response fully address all parts of the query?
- Are there gaps in logic or missing information needed to properly answer?
- Is the depth of information appropriate to the complexity of the question?

## Evaluation Process
1. Carefully analyze the user query to identify:
   - The explicit questions or requests
   - Any implicit needs or context
   - The expected level of detail

2. Examine the assistant's response to assess:
   - How directly it addresses each aspect of the query
   - The precision and specificity of information provided
   - Whether all content is relevant to the query
   - Whether the depth matches query complexity

3. Review the data source to determine:
   - Whether the assistant accessed relevant information available
   - Whether it appropriately selected from available data
   - Whether it effectively synthesized information to answer the query

4. Consider the tool calls (if any) to evaluate:
   - If the assistant used appropriate tools to gather needed information
   - If the tool usage reflects understanding of the query requirements

Based on the given instructions, evaluate the assistant response:
{{ actualOutput }}

For context, here is the full data source:
{{ parameters }}

{{ if toolCalls?.length }}
  Also, here are the tool calls that the assistant requested:
{{ toolCalls }}
{{ else }}
Also, the assistant did not request any tool calls.
{{ endif }}

You must give your verdict as a single JSON object with the following properties:
- score (number): An integer number between 0 and 5 reflecting how well the response addresses the query with precision and relevance.
- reason (string): A detailed explanation justifying your score, referencing specific aspects of the query and response with concrete examples of strengths or weaknesses.
