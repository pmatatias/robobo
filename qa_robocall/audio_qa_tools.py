"""
Audio QA Tools for Robocall Evaluation

This module provides functions to extract QA-relevant features from MP3 audio files, such as:
- Greeting timing ("SOP < 3 Detik")
- Smiling voice (emotion/prosody)
- Not interrupting (overlap/diarization)
- Hold duration ("On Hold â‰¤ 2 menit")

Dependencies (install as needed):
- pyAudioAnalysis
- pyannote.audio
- librosa
- numpy
- soundfile
- (optionally) openSMILE, commercial APIs for emotion

import os

def detect_greeting_timing(audio_path):
    """
    Detects the time (in seconds) from the start of the audio to the agent's first greeting.
    Returns:
        float: Time in seconds to greeting, or None if not detected.
    Notes:
        - Requires VAD and/or diarization to segment speech.
        - Optionally, use speech-to-text to confirm greeting word.
    """
    pass  # TODO: Implement using VAD/diarization and/or ASR


def detect_smiling_voice(audio_path):
    """
    Estimates whether the agent's voice is 'smiling' (friendly/professional) using emotion/prosody analysis.
    Returns:
        dict: { 'smiling': bool, 'confidence': float, 'details': str }
    Notes:
        - Use pre-trained emotion recognition models or commercial APIs.
        - openSMILE, pyAudioAnalysis, or external APIs can be used.
    """
    pass  # TODO: Implement using emotion/prosody analysis


def detect_interruptions(audio_path):
    """
    Detects if the agent interrupts the customer (overlapping speech).
    Returns:
        dict: { 'interruptions': int, 'details': str }
    Notes:
        - Use speaker diarization to segment speakers and detect overlaps.
        - pyannote.audio is recommended for diarization.
    """
    pass  # TODO: Implement using speaker diarization


def detect_hold_segments(audio_path, max_hold_seconds=120):
    """
    Detects 'hold' segments (silence or music) and checks if any hold exceeds the allowed duration.
    Args:
        audio_path (str): Path to the MP3 audio file.
        max_hold_seconds (int): Maximum allowed hold duration in seconds (default: 120).
    Returns:
        dict: { 'holds': list of (start, end, duration), 'exceeds_limit': bool, 'details': str }
    Notes:
        - Use VAD or silence/music detection to find hold segments.
        - pyAudioAnalysis or librosa can be used.
    """
    pass  # TODO: Implement using silence/music detection

# Example usage (to be implemented in your main QA pipeline):
# from audio_qa_tools import detect_greeting_timing, detect_smiling_voice, detect_interruptions, detect_hold_segments
# result = detect_greeting_timing("path/to/audio.mp3")
